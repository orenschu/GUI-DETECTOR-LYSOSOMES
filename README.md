## How do I obtain the diameter of lysosomes?

For a complete explanation of the method, click on the link below and obtain the explanatory document:
### Lysosome_Diameter_BlobLoG_FWHM.docx
It is located in the main directory of the directory

## What does FWHM mean?
FWHM means Full Width at Half Maximum. F = Full, W = Width, H = Half, M = Maximum. In the lysosome intensity profile, it is the full distance across the signal peak measured at 50% of the peak intensity. The script uses this width to estimate the lysosome diameter.

## Signal quantification 

### Quantify fluorescence and volume 3D

### Lysosomes

SIGNAL LYSOSOMES CORE = X

LYSOSOMES CORE VOL = Vx

### SIGNAL LYSOSOMES CORE AVERAGE

A = X / Vx

### Membrane

SIGNAL ADJ MEMBRANE = SIGNAL MEMBRANE - SIGNAL LYSOSOMES CORE

SIGNAL ADJ MEMBRANE = M

ADJ MEMBRANE VOL = Vm

### SIGNAL MEMBRANE AVERAGE

B = M / Vm

### Signal intensity coefficient of lysosomes relative to the membrane

PIMI = (A-B)/(A+B)

PIMI = -1; 0% SIGNAL LYSOSOMES and 100% SIGNAL MEMBRANE

PIMI = 0; 50% SIGNAL LYSOSOMES and 50% SIGNAL MEMBRANE

PIMI = 1; 100% SIGNAL LYSOSOMES and 0% SIGNAL MEMBRANE

## Recommended Installation: Anaconda Navigator

The recommended way to run **GUI-LYSOSOMES** is to use **Anaconda Navigator** with a dedicated Python environment. This keeps the required Python packages isolated from other projects and makes it easier to install the correct dependencies and run the Jupyter Notebooks.

### 1. Install Anaconda

Download and install **Anaconda Distribution** for your operating system:

* [Download Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
* [Official Anaconda Installation Guide](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/install)
* [Getting Started with Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/main)

Anaconda Distribution includes **Anaconda Navigator**, Python, conda, and Jupyter Notebook/JupyterLab.

### 2. Open Anaconda Navigator

After installing Anaconda, open **Anaconda Navigator** from your operating system.

Anaconda Navigator provides a graphical interface for:

* Creating and managing Python environments
* Installing packages
* Launching Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
* Selecting the environment used for a project

Official documentation:

* [Anaconda Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/products/navigator)
* [Conda Environment Management](https://www.anaconda.com/guides/conda-environment-management)

### 3. Create a dedicated environment

Create a dedicated environment for **GUI-LYSOSOMES**.

In **Anaconda Navigator**:

1. Select **Environments** from the left-hand menu.
2. Click **Create**.
3. Enter the following environment name:

```text
Python 3.12 (myenv)
```

4. Select **Python 3.12**.
5. Click **Create**.

The software was developed and tested using **Python 3.12.13**.

Using a dedicated environment is recommended because it keeps the packages required by this project separate from other Python projects and from the default `base` environment.

Tutorial:

* [Conda Environment Management](https://www.anaconda.com/guides/conda-environment-management)

### 4. Install the required packages

The repository contains a **`requirements.txt`** file with all the Python packages required by the software.

After creating the `Python 3.12 (myenv)` environment:

1. Open **Anaconda Navigator**.
2. Go to **Environments**.
3. Select **`Python 3.12 (myenv)`**.
4. Click the **play/arrow icon** next to the environment.
5. Select **Open Terminal**.
6. In the terminal, make sure that the `Python 3.12 (myenv)` environment is active.
7. Navigate to the folder containing this repository.
8. Run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs the required Python packages into the **`Python 3.12 (myenv)`** environment.

Tutorial:

* [Installing Packages with Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/working-with-conda/packages/install-packages)
* [Using pip in a Conda Environment](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/working-with-conda/packages/pip-install)

> **Important:** Install the packages inside the `Python 3.12 (myenv)` environment. Do not install them into the default `base` environment.

### 5. Download or clone the repository

You can obtain the repository either by cloning it with Git or by downloading it directly from GitHub.

#### Option A — Clone the repository with Git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/GUI-LYSOSOMES.git

```

### 6. Open the project environment and launch Jupyter

Once the environment has been created and the required packages have been installed:

1. Open **Anaconda Navigator**.
2. Select **Environments**.
3. Select the **`Python 3.12 (myenv)`** environment.
4. Go to the **Home** tab.
5. Make sure **`Python 3.12 (myenv)`** is selected as the active environment.
6. Locate **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab**.
7. Click **Launch**.

Jupyter will open in your web browser.

Official tutorials:

* [Getting Started with Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/main)
* [Working with Conda Environments](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/working-with-conda/environments)

### 7. Open the GUI-LYSOSOMES repository

After Jupyter opens in your web browser:

1. Navigate to the location where you downloaded or cloned the repository.
2. Open the **`GUI-LYSOSOMES`** folder.
3. You should see the following two notebooks:

```text
L3_GUI.ipynb
NOT_L3_GUI.ipynb
```

### 8. Select the appropriate notebook

The repository contains **two different notebook versions**. Select the notebook according to the quality of your microscopy images.

#### `L3_GUI.ipynb`

Use **`L3_GUI.ipynb`** for images with:

* Lower image quality and clarity
* More noise
* A less-clear background
* More false-positive lysosome detections
* Greater need for erosion
* Greater use of morphological processing

This version is particularly recommended for **larval-stage images**, which generally contain more noise, a less-clear background, and more false-positive lysosome detections.

#### `NOT_L3_GUI.ipynb`

Use **`NOT_L3_GUI.ipynb`** for images with:

* Higher image quality and clarity
* Much less noise
* A clearer background
* Greater contrast between cells and the background
* Fewer false-positive lysosome detections
* Less need for erosion
* Less use of morphological processing

### 9. Run the notebook

Open the appropriate notebook:

```text
L3_GUI.ipynb
```

or:

```text
NOT_L3_GUI.ipynb
```

After opening the notebook:

1. Make sure the notebook is using the **`Python 3.12 (myenv)`** Python environment.
2. Run the notebook cells **from top to bottom**.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to load and process your microscopy images.

> **Important:** Do not use the default `base` environment. The notebook should use the **`Python 3.12 (myenv)`** environment where the required packages were installed.
